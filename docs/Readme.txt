Bingoware v1.5

Author: Frédéric Demers
Software testing and new contributed graphics: Mike Suetkamp

10 December 2003

Bingoware is a simple open-source PHP script which facilitates the creation,
viewing and printing of randomly generated Bingo cards and provides a game 
play mode, which draws random bingo number and lists all the winning cards.

Bingoware is not intended for online gaming, but rather to ease the 
administration of a real-life Bingo. I once had to organize a Bingo and realized that
I could not photocopy Bingo cards (everybody would win at once!), so I created 
Bingoware. This software will help you create the cards, draw the numbers and 
verify the winning cards.  It allows the user to choose the winning pattern(s).

Using the Fooble Color Picker script (http://www.flooble.com/scripts/colorpicker.php)

4- Version History (Changelog)
5- To Do
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1- Requirements:

- A Javascript and CSS enabled web browser (Opera 7 and MSIE 6 have been tested and are
supported by Bingoware; Netscape 4 does not support the interactive web-based 
customization of winning patterns; Netscape 6 and 7 were not tested)

- A PHP-enabled web server with permissions to write files to the local directory.
Note:  Apache (httpd.apache.org) and Sambar (www.sambar.com) are both free web 
servers that I have tested and work with PHP (www.php.net)
Consults their documentation to install and configure either server with PHP
For Windows users, easyphp.manucorp.com has a pre-made package (easyphp) which 
installs and configures the most recent Apache web server, PHP and MySQL.

- approx 125 kB for the script files.  Creating sets of bingo cards
 will use up approx 1.5 kB per card (1000 cards ~= 1.5 MB)

--------------------------------------------------------------------

2- Installation Instructions (tested on Windows 98/ME/2000):

1-Extract the files into the documents directory of your web server
2-Point your browser to localhost/index.php
3-The script requires write access in the directory it is installed
4-Change the configuration parameters from the 'configure' menu item as you wish

--------------------------------------------------------------------

3- Key Definitions:

Free Squares Mode:  Bingoware gives you some flexibility when generating your set of cards.
You can choose to have a free square in the center of every card (will not help for winning 
patterns such as the perimeter of the Bingo card), no Free squares at all (slightly longer games),
or a randomly placed free square on all cards.

Set ID: The set ID is a unique identifier given to your set of cards. The set ID will always
prefix the card numbers when displayed on screen or printed out. You can have several sets of 
cards saved on the computer, which will remain untouched, simply by changing the set ID to a 
different letter or word. For example, if you generate a set 'A' of 10 cards, the cards will 
be numbered A0001-A0010. Once set 'A' is generated, you can change the set ID to 'Freddy-' 
and generate a new set of 20 cards (numbered Freddy-0001 to Freddy-0020). The original set remains 
untouched. This feature is very useful if you want to personalize several sets of cards. It also 
allows you to reload a previously generated set of cards.

Number of cards in play:  In game mode, the software will open the current set of cards (as indicated
by the setid variable in the config mode).  If you do not distribute all the cards you generated,
because for instance you did not get the crowd you expected or are charging too much for you cards,
then you can tell Bingoware not to consider all the cards.  The trick is to issue out your cards in
sequential order, and enter the number of the last card given away in the "number of cards in play" box.  You can
always change the number throughout the game if you gain or lose some people.  Bingoware will only 
announce winning cards for cards that are in play.

Manual vs Automatic Modes:  Bingoware can generate Bingo draws for you when in Automatic Mode.
The Manual Mode is meant for people using a different physical random number generator (such
as a barrel, lottery balls, ...)  Bingoware then lets you enter the draw directly instead  of
generating a random number, and will still be able to announce the winners.
