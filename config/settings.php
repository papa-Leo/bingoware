/* the variable setid allows the user to create different sets of cards
* The setid will appear in front of the card number: for example, if choosing
* setid to be 'A', the cards will be numbered from A0001 to ...
* The setid is also used with the filenames so that the user can transfer sets from
* one server to the next.  It also prevents the specific sets from being overwritten.
* The files will be named set.A.dat, winners.A.dat, and draws.A.dat.  If no file is found
* with the current setid, the user will be invited to generate a new set.
* Therefore if the user wants to keep the current set untouched, a simple change to the
* variabe below will behave as if there was no set generated.  Changing the setid back
* to the original will force the program to reopen the previous card set.
